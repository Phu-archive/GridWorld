def build_game(ascii_art, objs_info, obj_size):
    """
    Create the game object from ascii art and objects_information by
    creating difference layers, and pass it to the initilizer.

    Args:
        ascii_art (list of strings)
            The art for the game, must be in rectangle
            (meaning that the lenth of inside list shoud be the same)
            where, the empty string means nothing and the labeled characters
            are representing the object in game.

        objects_information (dictionary)
            We map the characters to prefab object, so that we can easily
            define their colors or behavior.

    Return:
        game (Game object) - Game object created by game class.

    Raises:
        ValueError - When the map is not a rectangle.
        AttributeError - object information isn't contain some
            characters from ascii_art.

    Example:
        Ascii Art

        ['########'
        ,'#      #'
        ,'#      #'
